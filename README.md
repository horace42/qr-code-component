## My process

### Built with

- Pulsar Editor
- Chrome Developer tools

### What I learned

This is my first challenge after completing the HTML & CSS section of the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.
Almost everything is brand new to me, as part of the challenge I learned how to position an element in the center of the screen.

### Continued development

I don't intend to become a web designer or front-end developer, but I need to have a solid knowledge in this area.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9622354/make-a-div-center-of-viewport-horizontally-and-vertically) - This helped me understand position: absolute and margins.
